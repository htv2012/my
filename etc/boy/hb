NAME

    hb - Uploads data to a hastebin server

SYNOPSYS

    hb [OPTION]... [FILE]...

DESCRIPTION

    When invoked without any file name, hb will reads from standard
    input. If the caller supplies the file names, each of them will be
    uploaded separately. Upon completion, hb will print to the standard
    output the URL for each upload.

    -h, --help
        Displays help and exit

CONFIGURATION

    By default, hb will upload to http://localhost:7777. If you
    want to upload to a different server, there are three ways to
    configure it.

    The first is to create a configuration file in the same directory
    of the script and name it `hb.json`. In a multiple-user
    environment, this configuration is meant to be global to all
    the users.

    The second is to create a per-user configuration file in
    `~/.config/hb.json`.

    Below is an example of such configuration file:

        {
            "HASTE_SERVER": "http://my-hastebin.com"
        }

    The third is to use an environment variable. Here is an example
    for the bash shell:

        export HASTE_SERVER=http://my-hastebin.com

    Below is the order of look-up to find the server, with the
    environment variable having the highest precedence:

        1. The environment variable
        2. The global configuration file
        3. The per-user configuration file
        4. If all failed, use http://localhost:7777

LOG

    hb keeps a log of all the URLs in ~/.hb.log
